# ProjectADS_Sample
Literacy/Language Analysis in Primary School Pupils2

This project is for the ADS Certificate in Data Science. The aim of the project was to explore and display by analysis the effects of 2nd language (3rd language) background speakers on English Comprehension at elementary level. Data was collected from over 1000 pupils indicating their year in primary school and their language background and other basic information. A simple comprehension test was included. The data was keyed in by data entry assistants. The Data PreProcessing is still on... It is a lot of work!
